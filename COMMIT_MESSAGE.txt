Integrate local google-play-scraper with bug fix

- Replaced npm google-play-scraper dependency with local copy (v10.0.0)
- Fixed TypeError in extractCategories function for apps with undefined categories
- Updated import path in lib/index.js to use local version
- Added google-play-scraper dependencies directly to package.json
- Removed postinstall script (no longer needed)
- Added MODIFICATIONS.md documenting all changes

This fixes the error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
that occurred when fetching certain apps like magalingpeso.cash.loan.
